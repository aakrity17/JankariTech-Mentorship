# Git Commands

- `git rebase [-i | --interactive] [ options ] [--exec cmd] [--onto newbase | --keep-base] [upstream [branch]]` - Git rebase can integrate the changes from one branch to another by overcoming the problems that we might have faced while using the git merge command. 

- `git bisect <subcommand> <options>` - This command uses a binary search algorithm to find which commit in your projectâ€™s history introduced a bug.
