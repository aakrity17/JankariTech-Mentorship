``Page Object Model, also known as POM, is a design pattern in CUcumber/Selenium that creates an object repository for storing all web elements. It helps reduce code duplication and improves test case maintenance``

# Clean Code Principles:
`` Clean Code refers to code that is easy to read,  understand, and maintain. Some key Principles includes: 
1. Descriptive Naming: Use Meaningful and descriptive names for variables, methods and  classes.

2. Avoid Duplication: Refactor code to eliminate redundancy. Don't repeat the same logic in multiple places.

3. Comments and Documentation: Write clear comments and documentation to explain the purpose of the code.

4. Consistency: Follow a consistent coding style throughout the project.
